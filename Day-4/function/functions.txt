Functions
A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can take inputs, called arguments. They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.

Example:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
