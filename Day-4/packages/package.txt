Packages
A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages help you organize related modules into a hierarchy. They contain a special file named __init__.py, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

Example:

Suppose you have a package structure as follows:

my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
You can use modules from this package as follows:

from my_package import module1

result = module1.function_from_module1()
In this example, my_package is a Python package containing modules module1 and module2.
